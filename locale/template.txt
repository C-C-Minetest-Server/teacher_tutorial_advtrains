About Trains...=
Trains are vehicles automatically running on their track. They connect distinct locations, providing convenient access to faraway areas.=
Trains show information to players by having an external display of the line number, and texts shown on the HUD upon hovering over the train.=
Trains often come with several wagons; each wagon can hold up a few passengers.=
Only trains with opened doors allow players to go on board. To board a train, walk inside a wagon with opened doors.=
To leave a train, wait for the door to open, then try to walk inside the train. You will be teleported out of the train, and onto the platform, if any.=
Alternatively, right-click (tap on mobile) the train to board or exit the train.=
Inside the train, texts may be displayed at the bottom showing the next station name. Get ready to leave the train once your destination shows up.=
Once the train is at a certain station, its name is displayed similarly.=
For the same reasons, you should never attempt to get off the train mid-journey. If you are in an emergency, hold down sneak (shift on computers) when you right-click.=
